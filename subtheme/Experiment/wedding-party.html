                                             <dd> Olivia and I do up road trips, but the best was Yellowstone.  We had a buffalo experience similar to this while we were driving in the park: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr2i3HZJ5Z4.</dd>

                                            <dd>One winter Saturday Mid semester Freshman year of college. Max believes he was wearing overalls and by the end of the night someone might have been bitten.</dd>

                                        <dt>Could you describe the once scripted tv show "24:Max & Lance?"</dt>
                                            <dd> We can't begin to describe the parody of 24 that Max and Lance's life was when they were roommates. It can be stated that it was the freshmen's worst nightmare if Max and Lance were out together.</dd>

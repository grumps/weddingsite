                    <p>This is such a unique opportunity for us to not only get to celebrate our disgusting love for one another, but to additionally catch up and spend quality time with the many of you that we rarely have the chance to see. We hope that you guys will help transform this wedding into a reunion weekend of sorts, so that we can actually have time to kick it with you and build even more lasting memories. Your presence means a lot and we promise you will not be disappointed in the affair!</p>

                <p>Our utterly romantic journey pretty much began with these two OkCupid messages. Max appreciated Olivia&rsquo;s boots, which is a necessary component of a successful relationship with her and Olivia seemed to be highly intrigued and perhaps mesmerized by Max&rsquo;s blatant disregard for dating profile etiquette. These simultaneous messages sent across the interwebs quickly turned into an obscene amount of texts and shortly thereafter a date was arranged.</p><p> We have been hanging out and keeping it awesome since August 10, 2011. Our first date was at The Big Hunt in Washington, DC. Olivia was fashionably 30 minutes late and Max was 2 minutes away from jumping ship. Olivia would like to publicly like to thank Max for sticking around because this duo fell in love shortly after high off of Old Bay seasoning during a massive consumption of Maryland crabs. </p><p>We always knew this day would come. Please note Olivia&rsquo;s original message to Max, duh she already proposed to him and he didn't hesitate then, so it was just a matter of formality at this point. Max strategically proposed to Olivia on May 1, 2013. May marks the month of Olivia because it is her birthday month, so no need to shower her with additional presents now and she can spend all summer occupied with wedding planning! The proposal was short and sweet &ndash; he asked and she said, &ldquo;ha yes!&rdquo; Then they ate barbecue, which is the end to any great tale.</p>
